Yo...nice to meet you. This is rabbit...Ughhhhh I hate this job.
You can input stuff that you want me to write on this grandma-aged notebook.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Type the type of a task followed by its content and time to add it into the list.
   There are three types: todo, deadline and event.
   - To add todo, type 'todo the content' such as 'todo do homework'.
   - To add deadline, type 'deadline the content /the time' such as 'deadline do homework /9am'.
   - To add event, type 'event the content /the time' such as 'event do homework /9am'.
2. Type 'list' then I'll show all the existing lines to you.
3. Type 'mark + the index of an existing task' to marks it as done. Like 'mark 1'.
4. Type 'unmark + the index of an existing task' to unmark a task.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually why not just do me a favour? Type 'bye' in the console and free both of us.
Ummm...what is that? I don't get it.
There is no task in the list.
Hey, be careful.
The index must be between 1 and the size of the list, alright?
Okay...noted.
play basketball ...Huh? Hope you can remember it.
Okay...noted.
do homework...Huh? Hope you can remember it.
Okay...noted.
meet with friends...Huh? Hope you can remember it.
That's a wrong format of creating a task.
That's a wrong format of creating a task.
Type 'mark + the index of the task' if that's what you want.
What do you mean? This task is not done in the first place.
Okay...task: play basketball  is marked as done.
What do you mean? This task is already marked as done.
Okay...task: play basketball  is unmarked.
Ummm...what is that? I don't get it.
Thanks a lot. I'm gonna have some carrot tea later. See you...
